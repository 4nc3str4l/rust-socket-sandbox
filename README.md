# Rust Socket Sandbox

Rust-Socket-Sandbox is an actively developed tool that provides an intuitive interface for interacting with WebSocket servers. It is specifically designed to simulate multiple users, facilitate manual message sending, and mimic user behaviors in a controlled environment.

This tool offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionalities that empower developers, testers, and WebSocket enthusiasts to "play around" with a WebSocket server, enabling the observation of responses and behaviors under varying conditions.

## Core Features

- **Multiple User Simulation**: Simulate numerous users interacting with your WebSocket server with ease. This can be crucial for understanding how your server handles multiple concurrent connections.

- **Manual Message Control**: Take full control over the messages that are sent to the server, providing fine-grained testing of server reactions to specific payloads.

## Future Plans

I am working on extending the capabilities of Rust-Socket-Sandbox, and here's a glimpse of what's on the horizon:

- **Stress Testing**: Aiming to equip Rust-Socket-Sandbox with stress testing capabilities to ensure your WebSocket server's resilience in high-load scenarios.

- **Fuzzy Testing**: An upcoming feature is fuzzy testing, which will enable testing of your server's handling of unexpected or malformed inputs.

Moreover, Rust-Socket-Sandbox seeks to leverage Rust's high performance to simulate more users than would be feasible with other languages. Utilizing Rust's async capabilities and Tokio, coupled with high-performance UI powered by Egui, the tool aims to provide an exceptional user experience while maintaining optimal performance.
